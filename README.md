# PreRex
###PreRex helps you to get ready

A project done to introduce myself to C, arduino/hardware prototyping, as well as to give me a long term project to do during my free time.

It's supposed to be able to switch my dorm room's light on and off at certain times and depending on if there is anyone in the room. Of course, it's also meant to be modular, so many more parts can be added, other arduinos can be attatched and communicate wirelessly, and more actions can be automated.

***Current Hardware:***
* *LCD Screen*
* *Pinpad*
* *2 PIR sensors*
* *Servo Motor*

***Planned Changes:***
* *Change servo model*
* *Add breadboard power supply module*
* *Modify and add cheap standard headphones or speakers*

***Possible Changes***
